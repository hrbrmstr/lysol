#' @note The CDC — Centers for Data Coherence — has warned that using \{lysol\} on your data
#'     is not recommended and may cause severe, irreparable data loss. But, what do they know?
#'     Where have "science" and "experts" gotten us? Still, you should probably test \{lysoln\}
#'     functions before using them in production (but only if you're one of those coward losers).
